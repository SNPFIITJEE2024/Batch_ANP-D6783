#a teacher is recording attendance as students enter the classroom. the class strength is 30 students. wap that counts the no. of students entering the classroom and displays the attendance count until all 30 students are present
# Initializing the attendance counter
count = 0
# The loop will run for up to 30 steps (from 1 to 30)
for i in range(0,31):
    # Increment the attendance count
    count += 1
    #printing the no. of students at that instant moment
    print ("no of students entered is: ", count)
