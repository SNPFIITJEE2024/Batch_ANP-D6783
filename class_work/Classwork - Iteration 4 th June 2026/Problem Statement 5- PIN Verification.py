#An ATM machine requires the user to enter the correct PIN to access their account. The valid PIN is 1234. Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter a PIN until the correct PIN is entered.

valid_pin = 1234
print("enter the 4 digit atm pin")
entered_pin = int(input(""Enter your 4-digit ATM PIN: ""))
while entered_pin != valid_pin:
    print("incorrect pin, access denied")
    entered_pin = int(input("entered pin wrong, try again"))
print("\n entered pin is correct, access granted, welcome")
