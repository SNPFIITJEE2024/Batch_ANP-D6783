#A customer is adding items to a shopping cart. The price of each item is entered one by one. Write a program that continuously accepts item prices and calculates the total bill amount. The program should stop accepting prices when the user enters 0.

total_bill_amount = 0
item_price = float(input("enter the price of item"))
while item_price != 0:
    total_bill_amount += item_price
    item_price = float(input("enter the price of item: "))
print("total amount is: ",total_bill_amount)
